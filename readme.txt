--- OVERVIEW ---
Thank you for your attention to this "readme.txt" file sir.

This file serves the purpose of addressing any issues that may can arise for you during the marking process.

Really appreciate your time!




--- DESCRIPTION ---
Our website has eye catching FRONTEND and well featured and very powerful BACKEND.

Any word or a image you can seen on Frontend is DYNAMIC. There's no any static contents sir.

We made everything Dynamic on our website by offering very powerful and easy to handle backend to our site-owner/client.

Languages we used is ;
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) PHP
4) SQL
5) javaScript / jQuery

Tried to include "COMMENTS" as much as possible insides in every type of code file. We tried to keep the code's simplisity along with the quality and standard best practices.
[You'll see on them code files sir.]

We mostly used JavaScript[on our syllabus] to develop site's FRONTEND.(Except on 3rd party libraries) [in Fromtend main.js]

But lately we decided to mostly use jQuery[Not in our syllabus. But you gave us permisson to use] for site's BACKEND. Because if we used javaScript there, we understood that we have to code soo much lines to get the same effect that we can easiest get coding by few jQuery lines.  [in Backend main.js]




--- FOLDER'S CONTENTS ---
1) img - Contains all the images.

2) css - Holds all the coded CSS files.

3) js  - Includes all the JavaScript files we coded.
       [ No jQuery was used directly; however, some third-party packages may include jQuery functions that includes in the 'vendor' folder. ]

4) vendor - Houses all third-party packages/libraries used in this project.
          [ All libraries that we used are open source sir. You can check them on GitHub or through a Google search. ]
          [ Bootstrap libraries are also included in here. ]

5) backend - Contains all the backend files except of few files we also used in the frontend too.
             [ Ex :- "db_connection.php" file includes in backend folder. But it's also calls in fronted php files too. ]

6) pages - Conatins all the php files that contain codes related to every site page.
           [ The site has 6 main pages ]

7) temps - Includes all the template parts used on Frontend pages.

The site has 13 tables.

 -> chefs
 -> contact
 -> emails
 -> events
 -> gallery
 -> home
 -> menu
